### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, This is my IP tracker react app.
I made this project just for fun, it allows you to see what your IP address is and roughly what arear you are in, as well as to search other IP address to see there rough location.

## MVP
Main MVP is to be able to search for diffrent IP address's and have them displayed on a map with their rough location,
also have the website automaticly pull your IP on the first load.

## Stretch
* Make site more mobile frendly
* have a save IP location
